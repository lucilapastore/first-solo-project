# Building with Backgrounds and Gradients [Solo Project] 

This project consists of building a webpage using images as a background and adding gradients to elements. The goal is to make a clone of an old version of the Apple website webpage. You can find the original project specifications [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients).

In this task, I used my newly-aquired knowledge of gradients and backgrounds. This is part of a series of projects to be completed by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) developers program.
